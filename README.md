# Predictive Model for Personal Loan Approval Using Machine Learning

# Background:
The financial industry is constantly evolving, and one of the key areas where technology can have a significant impact is in the process of personal loan approvals. Traditional 
methods of assessing an individual's eligibility for a personal loan often rely heavily on manual assessments, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and may not utilize 
the vast amount of data available today. Machine learning offers an opportunity to streamline this process, improve accuracy, and provide faster decisions for both borrowers 
and lenders.
# Project Objective:
The primary objective of this machine learning project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants and make automated recommendations 
for personal loan approvals or rejections. This model will leverage historical data on loan applicants, including their financial information, credit history, and personal details,
to make informed decisions.
# Machine Learning Algorithms:
We will explore various machine learning algorithms, such as Neural Network, Gradient Boosting Machines, random forests and XGBoost,, to develop a predictive model. The dataset
will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of each model and select the most suitable one.
